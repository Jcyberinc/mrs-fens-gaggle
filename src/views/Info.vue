    <p> You are given your first goose Huey by Ms. Fens! Hooray!</p>
    <p> She wants you to take care of Huey. </p>
    <p> Breed the geese you have at your disposal, as well as any who happen to wander in, by clicking on the two you wish to breed. </p>
    <p> Your goal is to impress Ms. Fens with a goose that has a combination of the best possible traits. </p>
    <p> When you're ready for Ms. Fens to rate your goose, click the "rate" button! </p>
    <p> If you don’t take care of them well enough, they’ll run off earlier to find a better caretaker. </p>
    <p> May the best geese win :) </p>
